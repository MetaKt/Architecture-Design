## Abstract
This research paper delves into the software architecture of React Native, a prominent open-source framework for building mobile applications. Renowned for its cross-platform compatibility and efficiency, React Native empowers developers to create native-like experiences across iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. 
This study focuses on analysing the architectural design of React Native, exploring its core components, data flow mechanisms, and integration with native APIs. By examining React Native's architecture, this paper aims to provide insights into its underlying principles maintability, scalability, and security for diverse mobile application development scenarios.

## 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Description
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, enabling developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It aims to combine the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The framework allows for the development of applications for Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase, promoting code reuse, and speeding up the development process. It enables developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Emphasizes declarative programming, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.
<br>As React Native has been rapidly evolving and widely adopted, the complexity of its software architecture is also increasing. Software architecture recovery can help to gain a deeper understanding of the framework's design and implementation, and improve its maintainability, scalability, and security.
<br>React Native was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.
React was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. It has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for web development, with a large community and ecosystem.
