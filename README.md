## Abstract
This research paper delves into the software architecture of React Native, a prominent open-source framework for building mobile applications. Renowned for its cross-platform compatibility and efficiency, React Native empowers developers to create native-like experiences across iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. 
This study focuses on analysing the architectural design of React Native, exploring its core components, data flow mechanisms, and integration with native APIs. By examining React Native's architecture, this paper aims to provide insights into its underlying principles maintability, scalability, and security for diverse mobile application development scenarios.

## 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Description
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, enabling developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It aims to combine the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The framework allows for the development of applications for Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase, promoting code reuse, and speeding up the development process. It enables developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Emphasizes declarative programming, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.
<br>As React Native has been rapidly evolving and widely adopted, the complexity of its software architecture is also increasing. Software architecture recovery can help to gain a deeper understanding of the framework's design and implementation, and improve its maintainability, scalability, and security.
<br>
<br>What is the story of React Native? 
<br>React Native was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.
React was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. It has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for web development, with a large community and ecosystem.
<br>
<br>What is the importance of React Native in the Modern Web Development? 
<br>React's component-based architecture not only helps in building scalable applications but also makes it easier to maintain and update them.
It's used by many large companies and startups alike, proving its capability to handle complex applications efficiently.
React's ecosystem includes tools like Create React App, Next.js, and Gatsby, which help developers start projects quickly and incorporate best practices.
<br>
<br>React fundamentally changed the way developers build web applications by introducing an efficient and flexible model for constructing user interfaces.
Its emphasis on component reusability, the virtual DOM, and a vibrant ecosystem makes it a cornerstone technology for modern web development.
<br>
<br>Their mainly 3 key quality(explained more into detail in the section ****) concerns are:
<br>
1. Maintanability
2. Performance
3. Scalability


## 1.2 File structure
The file structure of this document will organized into the following chapters:
<br>
1. "Chapter 2: stakeholders Analysis"...
2. "Chapter 3: Viewpoints Analysis"...
3. "Chapter 4: Perspective Analysis"...


## 2 Stakeholders analysis
In this section we will analyze the stakeholders of React Native. 

* Meta (formerly Facebook): They created React Native and are concerned with its long-term maintainability, performance across platforms, and fostering a healthy developer community.
* Software Developers: Developers using React Native are concerned with development speed, ease of learning, cross-platform compatibility, and access to a rich library of components and tools.
* The Open-Source Community: Contributors value code quality, adherence to best practices, modularity, and ease of contribution.
* Mobile App Development Companies: Companies using React Native prioritize development efficiency, app performance on target devices, and access to native functionalities.
* End Users: Users that use the applications developed with React Native.
* Project Managers: Oversee development projects using React Native.
* Corporate Sponsors: Companies that invest in React Native for their product development.
