## React Native
React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create cross-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android using a single codebase, which significantly reduces development time and effort.

At its core, React Native utilizes a declarative programming model, where developers describe the user interface in terms of components and their interactions. These components are reusable and can be composed together to build complex UIs.

One of the key features of React Native is its ability to render native UI components using JavaScript, providing a native-like performance and user experience. It achieves this through a bridge that communicates between JavaScript code and native platform code.

React Native also offers a hot reloading feature, allowing developers to see the changes they make in real-time without having to rebuild the entire application. This speeds up the development process and improves developer productivity.

Overall, React Native is a powerful framework for building mobile applications with a focus on efficiency, performance, and maintainability, making it an ideal choice for architectural recovery projects seeking to modernize and optimize existing mobile applications.
